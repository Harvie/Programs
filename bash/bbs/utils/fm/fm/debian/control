Description: Small, simple and efficient file system viewer for the console
 Small, simple and efficient file system viewer for the console. It offers fast
 navigation, easy invocation of your common tools
 (`Emacs`/`Vim`/`Xpdf`/`less`/...) and instant access to your favorite shell.
 It also can use Linux inotify to update the file tree.
