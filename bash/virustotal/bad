      ATENTION ATTENTION: VirusTotal is a free service offered by Hispasec
   Sistemas. There are no guarantees about the availability and continuity of
   this service. Although the detection rate afforded by the use of multiple
     antivirus engines is far superior to that offered by just one product,
     these results DO NOT guarantee the harmlessness of a file. Currently,
      there is not any solution that offers a 100% effectiveness rate for
                         detecting viruses and malware.
