Harvie's symetric encoding toolkit.


USAGE:

1. Generate key:
	keygen 128 > key.txt
	- keygen --help		for more options
	- this will 128 generate pseudorandom bytes (if number is not specified, 1024 will be used instead)
	- 128 may be size of encrypted file in bytes for optimal security.
	- You can use any file (MP3, EXE, etc...) instead of this.
	- The key mustn't contains the lots of NULL bytes

2. Encrypt
	crypt key.txt file.to.process file.output
	- crypt		for more options
	- key.txt is some file used as key
	- file.to.process is file to encrypt/decrypt by key (if not specified, STDIN is used)
	- file.output is output of process (if not specified, STDOUT is used)

3. Decrypt
	crypt key.txt file.output file.plain
	- decrypting is done the same way as encrypting, you need the same key for decrypting and for encrypting.
