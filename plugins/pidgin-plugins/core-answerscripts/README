libPurple core-answerscripts plugin
	Framework for hooking scripts to received messages for various libpurple clients

This simple plugin just passes every single message received by any libPurple-based client (pidgin,finch) to sript(s) in user's home directory... So you can add various hooks to your pidgin or finch without need of writing and compiling own C plugin or messing with buggy perl plugin and restarting client after each change in plugin.

There are already few sample (answer)scripts in purple directory, so you can check how easy it is to write some script for pidgin or finch...


The libpurple header files are needed to compile the plugin.

Building & installation:

To build and install :
	You can compile the plugin using
	$ make
	and install it with
	$ make install
	This will install it in ~/.purple/plugins so that only the user who install it can use it.
	$ make user
	Install main script and sample answerscripts to ~/.purple/answerscripts.d/

To install it for everybody on your computer,
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install PREFIX="/path/to/pidgin" (this command as root user)
	generally /path/to/pidgin is /usr or /usr/local. If you don't know the path then you can find out using
	$ whereis pidgin
	and look for the part before "/lib/pidgin".
