I've written those programs when i've been starting to explore programming world on MSDOS in 1998 or 1999 (i was ~8 years old), so i am commiting it just for fun.
Also note that some pieces were probably written by somebody else and edited by me later as whole floppy with TurboBASIC was passed around sneakernet...

You will probably need TurboBASIC 1.0 (or something like that) to make this programs working.
You can download it here: https://kyberia.sk/id/5358430/download or google it somewhere.
